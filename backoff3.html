      <h2>Context.</h2>
      <p>For one of the classes I've taken in University, I was tasked with doing a number of projects focused around
        analyzing a prototype, brainstorming and designing a improved version of that prototype, and iterating through
        user testing.
      </p>
      <p>This class was very focused on the fundamentals of HCI and taught me a lot about how products are developed,
        iterated upon,
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>This specific project was focused on the more and more prevalent issue of keyboards on small screens. With new technology constantly coming out,
        and with the smartwatch specicially gaining more popularity by the day, it's very important to design a solution for typing on small screens.
      </p>
      <p>For this project, we wanted to utilize n-grams NLP to make the speed of typing faster. Due to time limitations, we ended up implementing this
        in our third prototype with the order of the letters in each category. These letters were chosen in that order from n-grams. However, in the future,
        we would have liked to implement a more robust n-gram solution which would involve completing words, not just individual letters.
