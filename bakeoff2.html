      <h2>Context.</h2>
      <p>For one of the classes I've taken in University, I was tasked with doing a number of projects focused around
        analyzing a prototype, brainstorming and designing a improved version of that prototype, and iterating through
        user testing.
      </p>
      <p>This class was very focused on the fundamentals of HCI and taught me a lot about how products are developed,
        iterated upon,
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>This specific project was focused on a game where the user tries to move the square shown on screen to the
        indicated
        square outline that is lit up. To do this, they need to adjust the x, y, z, and rotational position of the
        square. As can
        be seen from this description, there were a lot of things to think about and many things that could be done to
        ensure
        the controlls for all these adjustments were as seemless and intuitive as possible.
      </p>
      <p>One limitation of this project was the use of the keyboard. We had to design this solution without any keyboard
        binds, with the user only utilizing
        the trackpad of their laptop.
